## Introduction

Since joining the team, I’ve had the opportunity to observe our delivery flow and speak to many of the ****. This document is not a critique — it’s simply a reflection on what I’ve seen and heard, offered as a __friendly, fresh pair of eyes__.

It aims to help us better understand a few key question:

> Why aren’t we delivering at the expected pace?

> Are there changes we can make to improve this?

> What obstacles (if any) make improving the process difficult?

I’ll offer some ideas, and open questions — along with suggestions that may be able to improve the perceived issues.

__To be clear:__ this is not a, __nothing works lets overhaul the whole process and do something new__. Making such an impactful change to quickly may result in confused messaging, and unintended consequences. Instead we may consider small, iterative improvements, test the results, and use retro to reflect on their impact ass a team. Note this is from a ** persepctive, I have not been looking at those working on **


## Whats Working Well
The following are my own observations, and feedback I have had from the team.

* __UI Design Walkthroughs:__ create excellent shared understanding.
* __Spikes:__ effective at highlighting complexity early.
* __UI Team Collaboration__: Strong cohesion and problem-sharing via Slack
* __Code Quality:__ One developer mentioned that **** is the best version of the UI he has worked on, due to it being the newest and excluding non **  choices
* __UI Tickets:__ Generally very clear, very visual and easier to pick up and run with than backend stories

## Why Delivery Slows Down
Again the following are my own observations, and feedback I have had from the team

### 1. Getting stories in the backlog
* Stories are often written and created in bulk after requirements have been settled. This results in a mesh of dependencies and assumptions, particularly on the backend.
* Stories in the backend read like technical specs.
  
### 2. Epics run for more than 2 sprints
* ideally we should be working 
* Mnay apps use thw same backend -this is being crrected, but does need to be called out. In previous iterations we have seen a change being blocked due to others
* 


Story points ?? 
If I asked what would be the typical velocity of a average frontend developer what would it be?

Spikes, can we aggresivly time box them. Who can do them?
