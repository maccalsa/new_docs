## üëã Purpose

As a fresh pair of eyes on the team, I‚Äôve been gathering insights from recent 1:1s, team observations, and delivery experience. This short summary highlights a few recurring themes and small, low-risk opportunities that might help explain why delivery sometimes moves slower than expected.

This isn‚Äôt a proposal to overhaul our process ‚Äî just a friendly contribution toward our shared delivery goals. These are **observations**, not absolutes, and can be challenged or corrected where needed.

---

## üöß Key Observations

- **Stories are front-loaded and overly rigid**  
  Stories are often created in bulk after analysis and handed to the team with many dependencies. This creates critical paths that make parallel delivery difficult. Stories seem to reach the backlog only once UCD and business analysis are ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù  
  ‚Üí *Is our Definition of Ready too strict?*

- **Delivery is slowed by shared backend/API**  
  All four apps depend on the same backend, and while work is ongoing to deduplicate this, there‚Äôs still no clear API ownership. One team‚Äôs changes can unintentionally affect others.

- **Blockers surface too late**  
  Teams don‚Äôt always escalate blockers early ‚Äî sometimes due to unclear ownership or confidence. Having a Lead Developer role should help support earlier intervention.

- **Documentation is too heavy and disconnected**  
  Developers prefer simple, in-repo docs (e.g., markdown) over outdated or scattered Confluence pages. Anything technical or architecture-related should live closer to the codebase.

- **Team capability is uneven, and knowledge is at risk**  
  Some critical knowledge is held by contractors who may leave later this year. Newer team members can be hesitant to ask for help or escalate issues.

- **Team divides are subtle but real**  
  There‚Äôs a friendly but real divide between Team1/2 and Team3. The naming of Slack channels may reinforce this separation, even if people remain collaborative.

- **Too many Slack channels**  
  It‚Äôs hard to track conversations across feature-specific and team-specific channels.  
  ‚Üí Could we try including all devs in feature channels to improve visibility and ‚Äúosmosis learning‚Äù?

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working Well

- **UI design walkthroughs** ‚Äì create excellent shared understanding  
- **Spikes** ‚Äì effective at identifying unknowns early  
- **UI team collaboration** ‚Äì strong use of Slack to solve problems  
- **Code quality** ‚Äì newer UI apps are praised for their clarity and decisions  
- **UI tickets** ‚Äì visual, clear, and easier to pick up than backend ones

## üîÑ Role of a Lead Developer

As I grow into the Lead Developer role, my aim is to help bridge the gap between teams, tech, and delivery. That means reinforcing shared understanding, surfacing blockers early, and supporting confidence and momentum across the team ‚Äî without adding unnecessary layers of process.

## üí° Opportunities to Explore (Small, Measurable Changes)

| Opportunity                              | Why It Might Help                                         |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lightweight Definition of Ready**      | Avoids front-loading and encourages earlier dev input     |
| **API stewardship / ownership**          | Reduces cross-app breakages and builds trust              |
| **‚ÄúContract stories‚Äù for UI ‚Üî API**       | Allows FE/BE to work in parallel against shared contract  |
| **Review story structure**               | Reduce critical paths and unblock parallel work           |
| **Smarter documentation**                | Bring docs closer to the code for clarity and relevance   |
| **Pairing on key stories**               | Upskills team, reduces single-point reliance              |
| **Earlier blocker visibility**           | Helps leadership plan support more proactively            |
| **Channel rationalisation**              | Reduce Slack noise and improve cross-team awareness       |

## üß± User Story Options (Exploratory)

> These are exploratory ‚Äî not proposals, but possible models to reflect on.

### Option 1: Vertical Slices

**Pros:**

* Testable units of value
* FE and BE work on the same story
* Stories should complete within a sprint

**Cons:**

* Requires mindset and workflow shift across teams
* Difficult without full cross-functional buy-in

---

### Option 2: Contract Story Model

**Pros:**

* Less disruptive to existing workflow
* FE and BE can deliver independently to the same contract
* Final contract story integrates and verifies both ends

**Cons:**

* Still requires coordination and ownership to maintain contract integrity

## ü§ù Final Thought

This is just one view, shared with humility and curiosity. I‚Äôm excited to work with you all to explore a few of these ideas in a low-risk, collaborative way ‚Äî and see what helps us move with more confidence and consistency.

Thanks for reading,
