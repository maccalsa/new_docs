Got it. Since you’re stepping into a Lead Developer role without prior management experience, here's a tailored **"First 90 Days Plan"** to help you thrive — not just survive.

---

## ✅ **Your First 90 Days as Lead Developer**

### 🕐 **Phase 1: Orientation (Days 1–30)**

> *"Observe, listen, and learn before you lead."*

#### 🧭 Understand the Landscape

* [ ] Meet the team (devs, PMs, QAs, designers)
* [ ] Learn the business goals of your project
* [ ] Understand the current architecture and pain points
* [ ] Audit the current process (Jira, stand-ups, deployments, QA, etc.)

#### 🤝 Build Trust

* [ ] Set up 1:1s (informal coffee chats at first)
* [ ] Ask questions, not give answers (yet)
* [ ] Let the team know you're here to support, not to dominate

#### 🧠 Capture Quick Wins

* [ ] Find low-hanging improvements (scripts, small refactors, flaky tests)
* [ ] Contribute code where needed, but don't hoard tasks
* [ ] Document what’s unclear or undocumented

---

### 🧱 **Phase 2: Foundation (Days 31–60)**

> *"Start shaping, not shaking."*

#### 🔨 Begin Improving Structure

* [ ] Propose a small improvement to the process (e.g., more structured PR reviews, tagging owners)
* [ ] Identify and promote patterns that reduce tech debt
* [ ] Help the team define clear responsibilities (per ticket, per role)

#### 🎓 Share Knowledge

* [ ] Offer mentoring without judgment
* [ ] Share tech learnings, do brown-bag talks or design walkthroughs
* [ ] Set the tone for documentation and coding standards (by example)

#### 📢 Communicate Upward

* [ ] Keep stakeholders in the loop with short, clear updates
* [ ] Translate dev issues into business language
* [ ] Help PMs understand technical constraints and trade-offs

---

### 🚀 **Phase 3: Impact (Days 61–90)**

> *"Scale yourself by enabling others."*

#### 📈 Lead, Don’t Just Do

* [ ] Step back from day-to-day coding (somewhat)
* [ ] Empower team members to own features or refactors
* [ ] Make space for their voices in planning and retros

#### 🧰 Define Vision and Roadmap

* [ ] Introduce or refine technical roadmap (what’s next, why, who owns it)
* [ ] Collaborate with product to align technical + business strategy
* [ ] Help establish vertical slicing if needed (frontend + backend + testing per story)

#### 🧠 Reflect and Iterate

* [ ] Ask for feedback from the team and your manager
* [ ] Reflect on your leadership style: what’s working, what’s not
* [ ] Schedule regular 1:1s going forward

## 💡 Pro Tips for New Lead Devs

* **Be a shield** from chaos, not a source of it
* **Ask more than you tell**, especially at the start
* **Keep a private journal**: capture decisions, lessons, and frustrations
* **It’s okay to say “I don’t know”** — but follow it up with “I’ll find out”
