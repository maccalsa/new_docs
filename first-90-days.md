## 🛠️ Tools and Templates

### 📋 1:1 Template
Use for regular check-ins with teammates (bi-weekly is typical):
```
1. How are you feeling this week?
2. Any blockers or frustrations?
3. Anything going particularly well?
4. What feedback do you have for me?
5. What can I help with next?
```

### 📆 Weekly Status Template
Share with your manager or product lead:
```
✅ Done:
- 
🔄 In Progress:
- 
🚧 Blocked:
- 
📌 Risks or Concerns:
- 
📅 Coming Up:
- 
```

### 🔄 Retrospective Format
Use monthly or after major releases:
```
- What went well?
- What didn’t go well?
- What can we improve?
- Actions (with owners)
```
Can be async or real-time — try to keep it under 45 mins.

### 🗺️ Tech Roadmap Outline
Capture longer-term improvements:
```
Q3 Goals:
- Upgrade to ___
- Refactor ___ for performance
- Automate ___

Risks:
- Legacy code ___
- Skills gap in ___
```
Review and evolve quarterly.

### 🧩 Ticket Writing & Story Slicing
- Write stories as "vertical slices" (backend + frontend + tests)
- Prefer outcome-driven titles (e.g. “User can upload profile picture”)
- Break large features into smaller, testable steps
- Each story should have:
  - Description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies noted
  - Owner

---

## 📅 Weekly Checklist (Sample)
Use or adapt this to keep yourself on track.
```
🔁 Weekly Lead Dev Routine:
[ ] Attend or lead stand-up
[ ] Review 2+ PRs with mentoring mindset
[ ] Run 1:1(s) and document action items
[ ] Check in with PM for roadmap sync
[ ] Look ahead: Is work well sliced? Are we blocked?
[ ] Write or revise 1 internal doc (or propose it)
[ ] Reflect on something that went well / could improve
```

---

## 🗣️ Team Meeting Formats

### Stand-Up (Daily, 10–15 mins)
Everyone answers:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Any blockers?
Keep it focused. Side-discussions after.

### Sprint Planning (Every 1–2 weeks)
- Review what's done / carried over
- Go over new stories and tech details
- Confirm estimates and owners
- Ensure priorities align with product/PM

### Retro (End of Sprint)
See retro format above. Your job is to:
- Encourage honesty without blame
- Facilitate actions — not just venting
- Document what you’ll *actually change*

### Technical Sync (Ad-hoc or Weekly)
- Use this for design decisions, refactor planning, cross-cutting concerns
- Keep short agendas and use diagrams if possible

---

## 🧘 Confidence-Building Routine
Try this weekly if you're feeling unsure:
```
1. What did I help the team accomplish?
2. What conversations went well?
3. What decisions or actions am I proud of?
4. What am I unsure about?
5. What can I do next week to improve?
```
You are not expected to know everything. You are expected to care, learn, and help the team move forward.
