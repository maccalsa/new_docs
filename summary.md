## 👋 Purpose

As a fresh pair of eyes on the team, I’ve been gathering insights from recent 1:1s, team observations, and delivery experience. This short summary highlights a few key themes and small opportunities for improvement that could help us understand why delivery sometimes moves slower than expected.

This is not a proposal to overhaul the process — just a friendly contribution to support our shared goals.

---

## 🚧 Key Observations

* **Stories are front-loaded and overly rigid**
  Stories are written in bulk after requirements workshops, with many dependencies between them. This limits team flexibility and can delay value delivery.

* **Delivery is slowed by shared backend/API**
  Four apps depend on the same backend without clear API ownership. One change can unintentionally affect others.

* **Blockers often surface too late**
  Teams sometimes hesitate to raise blockers until it’s already affecting delivery — possibly due to unclear ownership or support pathways.

* **Documentation is too heavy, too disconnected**
  Developers prefer simple, code-adjacent docs over scattered or outdated Confluence pages.

* **Team capability is uneven and at risk**
  Some critical knowledge lives with contractors who may leave later this year. Newer team members sometimes lack confidence to ask or escalate.

## 🔄 Role of a Lead Developer

As I grow into the Lead Developer role, my goal is to help bridge the gaps across tech and delivery — by reinforcing context, surfacing blockers earlier, and helping translate evolving needs into shared understanding. I hope to support both consistency and flexibility across the team.

## 💡 Opportunities to Explore (Small, Measurable Changes)

| Opportunity                                 | Why It Might Help                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lightweight Definition of Ready**         | Prevents false starts and mid-sprint confusion               |
| **API stewardship or ownership**            | Reduces cross-app risk and builds confidence in changes      |
| **Introduce "contract stories" for UI↔API** | Aligns teams around data flow and boundaries earlier         |
| **Smarter docs**                            | Focus on in-repo, close-to-code clarity                      |
| **Support pairing on critical stories**     | Builds shared knowledge, reduces reliance on few individuals |
| **Make blockers more visible, earlier**     | Supports better intervention and planning                    |
