Given you're on **AWS with Kubernetes + Terraform**, and have:

* 1 **write (primary) replica**
* 1 **read replica**
* Likely **RDS for Postgres/PostGIS**

Here‚Äôs a battle-tested approach:

## üß® Upgrading a PostGIS Database on AWS (Not Just Schema)

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Strategy (Zero or Minimal Downtime)

#### **1. Confirm What You're Dealing With**

* Is it **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL/PostGIS**? Or self-hosted Postgres in a pod?

  * 99% chance: **RDS**
* You cannot upgrade Postgres **in-place** from Kubernetes if it's RDS ‚Äî use **RDS upgrade process**

#### **2. Create a Manual Snapshot**

* **Always snapshot the DB manually** before attempting a major version upgrade:

  ```bash
  aws rds create-db-snapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier your-db-id \
    --db-snapshot-identifier pre-upgrade-snapshot-2025-07-02
  ```

#### **3. Temporarily Disable Terraform on the DB**

* If Terraform manages RDS:

  * **Comment out** or **import and ignore** the DB resource using `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` to avoid Terraform trying to destroy/recreate it.

#### **4. Upgrade the Read Replica First**

* You **cannot upgrade a replica independently** ‚Äî you must promote it **then** upgrade.
* If your goal is zero-downtime, the trick is:

  * Promote the read replica to **a standalone instance**
  * Upgrade it **first** (acts as a dry run)
  * Test apps against it (ensure PostGIS compatibility)

#### **5. Schedule Primary Upgrade**

* For the write/primary instance, AWS supports **major version upgrades** via:

  ```bash
  aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier your-db-id \
    --engine-version 15.5 \
    --allow-major-version-upgrade \
    --apply-immediately
  ```
* ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause **brief downtime (\~2‚Äì5 minutes)** during switchover

#### **6. Reattach/Resync Read Replicas**

* After the write upgrade, recreate the read replica off the upgraded primary

#### **7. PostGIS Compatibility Check**

* Verify that the PostGIS extension is installed for the **new version**

  ```sql
  SELECT postgis_version();
  ```
* If PostGIS is broken, you may need to:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
  ```

---

## üß† What to Watch For

* **App compatibility**: Test apps thoroughly against upgraded replica
* **Terraform drift**: If Terraform tries to destroy/replace DB, it will cause downtime
* **Upgrade windows**: Prefer doing this during off-peak hours

---

## üõ†Ô∏è If You're *Not* Using RDS?

If the DB is actually self-managed inside Kubernetes (e.g. running in a pod on an EBS volume), then:

* You‚Äôd build a **new StatefulSet** with the upgraded image (`postgres:15-postgis`)
* Mount the same PV, start Postgres, and run `pg_upgrade`
* But this is **much messier** and riskier ‚Äî confirm RDS first

---

## üÜò Want Help Planning It?

If you can confirm these:

* [ ] Is it RDS Postgres (yes/no)?
* [ ] What version are you on, and what are you upgrading to?
* [ ] How is the DB managed in Terraform (just infra? or also DB-level)?
* [ ] Is downtime acceptable (even if 2‚Äì5 mins)?
* [ ] Can we promote a replica for testing first?

Then I can walk you through a **specific plan with exact AWS + Terraform + Kubernetes commands**.
