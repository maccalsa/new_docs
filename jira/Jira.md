* Implement input field for keyword/title search.
* Add clear status badges indicating Published or Archived.
* Ensure UI accessibility (ARIA tags, tab navigation).

### 🛠️ **Sub-task:** \[Articles]\[API] Article Search Endpoint

## 📌 **Story:** \[Publishing]\[References] Individual References and Comments Control

**Story Description:**
*As an editorial user, I want granular control to individually publish or archive references and comments within already published articles, ensuring I can maintain editorial standards.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* ✅ Users can select references/comments to individually publish/archive.
* ✅ Publishing a reference/comment makes it publicly visible within the context of its article.
* ✅ Archiving a reference/comment hides it from public view but keeps it available internally.
* ✅ If a user archives the last published reference, the entire article and its comments are automatically archived.
* ✅ UI clearly indicates when actions may cause automatic article archival.

### 🛠️ **Sub-task:** \[Publishing]\[UI] Reference & Comment Management UI

* Develop intuitive UI components (toggle/button) for publish/archive actions on references and comments.
* Clearly indicate the status of each reference/comment (published, archived).
* Add confirmation dialog warning if archiving would archive the entire article.

### 🛠️ **Sub-task:** \[Publishing]\[API] Reference & Comment Archiving Logic

* Implement REST endpoints:

  * `POST /api/v1/articles/{id}/references/{refId}/publish`
  * `POST /api/v1/articles/{id}/references/{refId}/archive`
  * `POST /api/v1/articles/{id}/comments/{commentId}/publish`
  * `POST /api/v1/articles/{id}/comments/{commentId}/archive`
* Ensure privilege checks on each endpoint.
* Implement automatic archival logic:
  **If** a reference archived is the **last published reference**
  **Then** automatically archive the entire article and associated comments.

### 🛠️ **Sub-task:** \[Publishing]\[DB] Schema and Trigger Logic for Auto-Archiving

* Update schema to clearly indicate status flags on references/comments/articles.
* Write SQL triggers or backend application logic:

  * Detect when the last published reference is archived.
  * Automatically archive parent article and associated comments.
* Comprehensive unit and integration tests covering automatic archival logic.
