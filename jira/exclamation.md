Here's a thoughtful and balanced way you might communicate this to your team, highlighting clearly why smaller Epics are beneficial, while acknowledging their reasons and without sounding condescending:

---

## 🚩 **Acknowledging the Team's Concern:**

> "I understand why the team initially sees the whole screen as a single Epic—it feels natural since all features seem tightly related and it's easy to think of them together. It's common for teams to approach a complex screen as one large chunk of work because it initially appears simpler and easier to manage as a single unit."

---

## ⚠️ **Challenges with Large Epics (Why It's Problematic):**

* **Reduced Visibility and Clarity:**

  * Difficult to see precise progress across multiple sprints.
  * Lack of clarity on what's truly "done."

* **Risk of Integration Delays:**

  * UI, backend, and DB integration tends to happen later, causing unexpected issues.

* **Higher Risk & Late Discoveries:**

  * Issues only surface late, limiting the ability to pivot quickly.

* **Motivation and Momentum Loss:**

  * A large Epic spanning multiple sprints can negatively impact team morale, as it's hard to celebrate incremental successes.

> **Example:**
> "If we bundle 'Article Management' into one huge Epic, we might only find out late in the process that publishing logic has hidden complexities. Delays could ripple through our delivery timeline, creating frustration."

## ✅ **Why Smaller, Clearly Scoped Epics are Beneficial (Best Practice):**

* **Increased Visibility & Frequent Wins:**

  * Shorter Epics allow teams to clearly see progress and celebrate incremental successes.

* **Lowered Risk:**

  * Issues and integration problems surface earlier, allowing quick and efficient resolution.

* **Faster Feedback:**

  * Smaller pieces deliver working software quickly, allowing for early stakeholder and user feedback.

* **Improved Flexibility:**

  * Easier to adjust and reprioritize when unexpected changes occur, without affecting multiple sprints.

> **Example:**
> "By breaking 'Article Management' into smaller Epics like 'Search and Filtering,' 'Publishing Logic,' and 'Comments & References,' we can deliver each independently. If we encounter challenges with one, it doesn't impact the entire feature set."

---

## 📌 **Balanced Communication to the Team (Non-Condescending & Collaborative):**

Here's how you might phrase it clearly and empathetically:

> "I've been thinking about our discussion on handling the new complex screen as one large Epic. I understand the logic behind managing it as one large piece—it seems simpler upfront, and all parts feel closely connected.
>
> However, based on past experiences, I've found that breaking larger Epics into smaller, clear, independently valuable Epics can help us avoid common issues—like delayed integration, unclear progress, and late discovery of problems. It helps us quickly adapt to changes, celebrate small victories more frequently, and maintain good visibility throughout the process.
>
> I'd suggest we try breaking down this complex screen into smaller functional areas or Epics. This approach gives us the best chance at staying agile, flexible, and successful.
>
> **Can we give this a try for our next set of tasks?**
>
> I'd love to hear your thoughts or concerns."

---

This approach shows:

* Respect and understanding of their reasoning.
* A balanced presentation of why large Epics can be problematic.
* Clear, practical benefits of adopting smaller Epics.
* An invitation for feedback, encouraging a team-oriented conversation.
