Perfect. Here's a **complete guide** to help you **run this kind of feature kickoff smoothly and confidently** — with templates and prompts included.

## 💬 Slack Message Template: Feature Kickoff Invite

```markdown
👋 Hey team,

We’re starting work on a new feature: **[Feature Name]**, and I’d really value your input.

To help shape the backlog and avoid past pitfalls, I’ll be hanging out in a Slack huddle **[insert time window]** right here in this channel.

If you’ve worked on similar things before — or just have ideas about how we can break this up smartly — pop in for a few minutes. No pressure, just open discussion.

**Topics we’ll touch on:**
- How would you break this down?
- Any known risks or blockers?
- Reuse opportunities from past features?
- Anything that’s burned us before?

I’ll share a summary afterwards and start drafting the initial tickets. See you there!
```

## 🧠 Huddle Prompts: What to Ask in the Conversation

You don’t need to “run the meeting” — just guide it like a facilitator. Use these prompts:

### 🚧 Discovery & Risks

* “What’s the first thing that jumps out as tricky?”
* “Have we done anything like this before?”
* “Where did things go wrong on similar work?”

### 📦 Slicing Work

* “What would a good vertical slice look like here?”
* “If we were demoing this in 1 week — what would be in that first piece?”
* “Which parts can we work on in parallel?”

### 🔁 Reuse & Patterns

* “Is there code we should reuse or refactor first?”
* “Have we already solved part of this elsewhere?”

### 🧪 Testing & QA

* “What would be hard to test here?”
* “Should we involve QA or product now on any assumptions?”

## 📝 After the Huddle: Follow-Up Slack Message

```markdown
Thanks to everyone who joined the huddle for [Feature Name] — great input!

Here’s a quick summary:
- Key risks: [X, Y, Z]
- Suggested slices: [A, B, C]
- Follow-ups: [Write spike ticket for X, sync with design on Y]

Next step: I’ll draft the initial set of tickets and share for review.

If you missed the chat and want to add anything, feel free to DM me or reply here.

## 👑 Lead Developer Confidence Tip

> **“Leadership is creating clarity and reducing chaos.”**

You don’t need to have all the answers. You just need to **start the right conversations** — and you’re doing exactly that.

Would you like a short **ticket slicing checklist** next, or a **how to write better Jira stories** doc for the team?







👋 Quick note on story planning:

There’s a solid set of story and ticket templates written by [Previous Lead Dev] that cover things like:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Consistent structure
- Edge case reminders

If you haven’t seen them before — they’re worth a quick look:
👉 [Link to templates or Jira ticket]

We’ll be drafting a few new stories this week, so feel free to use these as a base. Totally open to tweaking or evolving them as we go.

If you have thoughts or gaps, let’s improve them together.
